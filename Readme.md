- BUT, the player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his CURRENT score gets added to his TOTAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on TOTAL score wins the game or one can choose the maximum winning score upto which they need the game to continue
